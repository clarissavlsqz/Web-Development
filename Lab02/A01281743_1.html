		<p>Hi! I am Clarissa and have 21 years old, currently studying Computer Science at Tec de Monterrey.</p>
		<div>B.S Computer Science Engineer</div>
		<p>I believe the tech area is a big tree that has a lot of branches
			where one can choose which to try or pick. I like the idea of having a lot
			roads and try them. I still don't know which path to take but it's nice to know that there are choices.
			Technology is one of the main components that make us 
			advance, develop and strike for the future we've seen in science fiction
			movies, and I would like to be part of that.
